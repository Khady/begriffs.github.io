title: About
---

I build tools to collect data, analyze it and repackage it in clean
APIs. I combine a rigorous math education with experience designing
and scaling web apps. Everything from database optimization to
meticulous HTTP semantics, to distributed computing. If you're
solving an ambitious data problem then [let's
talk](mailto:joe@begriffs.com).

My previous work includes

* Data acquisition and econometrics for a grocery search engine
* API versioning and refactoring at Bountysource
* A proxy server to transform HTML for mobile devices with Moovweb
* The infrastructure to collect online resumes for CareerBuilder
* Job scheduling used by scientific projects like the Large Hadron
  Collider at CERN
* Automating compilation of circuit court records for Thomson Reuters
* Realtime collaborative editing API at the Public Library of Science
* Statistical analysis of respondent privacy at the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study
