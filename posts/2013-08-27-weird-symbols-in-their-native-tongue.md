title: Weird symbols in their native tongue
---

Ever play charades? You need to make your audience understand the
word in your head by acting it out. Well that's what we're going
to do in a series of blog posts. Except the words I am thinking of
don't exist in English. Yeah, people give them pseudo-math names,
but those are uninformative too.

It doesn't help to name concepts with weird squiggles like "<span
style="color: #999999; font-family: Trebuchet MS,
sans-serif;">a</span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span
style="color: #999999; font-family: Trebuchet MS,
sans-serif;">p</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,
Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">_p_</span></span>_<span style="font-family:
Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">l</span><span
style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size:
large;">i</span>_<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,
sans-serif;">c</span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New
Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">a</span><span
style="color: #cccccc; font-size: x-large;">t</span></span><span
style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size:
x-large;">i</span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,
sans-serif;">v</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',
sans-serif; font-size: large;"><u>e</u> </span><span style="font-family:
Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:
large;">f</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">u</span></span>_<span
style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">n</span><span
style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size:
large;">c</span>_<span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family:
Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: large;">t</span><span
style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size:
xx-small;">o</span></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,
sans-serif;">**r**</span>". If you look at old-fashioned math the
names are always simple and are meant to suggest an analogy, because
the primary function of math is to communicate precise intuition.
So I'm going to find examples of `<$>` and `<*>` in action and see
if we can spot the general pattern of how they work.

But I simply don't have time to finish it tonight. I've spent my
day after work struggling through [this
paper](http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf) and
looking for examples online. I have a few examples to work with now
but not enough to for you (or me!) to solve the charades puzzle.

**Want to help me out?** Comment on this article with some of your
favorite, idiomatic, useful examples using applicative functors
acting on various types.
