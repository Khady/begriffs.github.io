title: Overthrowing Syntactic Rituals
---

I have recently noticed a refreshing trend within the open source
community. Some very talented people are writing libraries to clarify
the syntax of existing languages and applications, much like the
[Elements of Style](http://www.bartleby.com/141/) cleans up English
writing.

Computer science is full of repeated ideas, endless variations of
trees, caches, hashes, queues, events, codes, exceptions etc. Day
by day new developers learn these concepts, but often through the
lense of a particular language or library. After repeated association,
the concepts can fuse in developers' minds with a certain syntax.
Before long, it feels comfortable, even "correct" to write things
a certain way.

I like to think of these syntactic habits as rituals. It's as if
writing gnarly half-understood incantations somehow purifies our
software and proves us to be in the programming priesthood. Think
of all the details in old-style HTML `DOCTYPES`, or of the
obsessive-compulsive repetition in XML documents.

Luckily, I think the industry is waking from its syntactic trance,
and designing languages to write ideas more concisely.
