title: Structuring a Code Dojo
---

Enthusiasts often form&nbsp;[code
dojos](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo)&nbsp;to help
each other improve. A common format for these meetings is for the
group to gather around a projector and watch/coach a pair of
developers through a challenge.

I am interested in starting a dojo with a different format. The
group would meet regularly and tackle bigger or ongoing projects.
The dojo itself could be set up like this: a central area with small
attached rooms. Each room would have a blackboard and a desk with
two chairs. The members would pair off and enter a room to work on
the current challenge. After a set amount of time, the pairs would
emerge and see which made the best progress. If the challenge
remained unsolved, the group would shuffle pairings and go back to
the rooms. Repeat.

I think this helps nurture diverse solutions while keeping the teams
on track and introducing a healthy urgency. It also allows members
to interact more thoroughly and learn each others' ways of thinking.

Doing exercises in classic computer science books
([SICP](http://amzn.to/pjgjBV),&nbsp;[TAOCP](http://amzn.to/prTBPh),&nbsp;[Elements](http://amzn.to/ppgIo5))
might be particularly suited to this format. The group could record
their polished solutions in a public repository.
