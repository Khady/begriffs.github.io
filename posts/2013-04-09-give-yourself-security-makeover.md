title: Give Yourself a Security Makeover
---

While visiting Twilio for a day on my two-week [programming
pilgrimage](2013-03-08-the-pilgrimage-begins.html) I learned that
I've been pretty insecure. JoÃ«l Franusic ([@jf](https://twitter.com/jf))
explained that I needed a security makeover. You probably do too!
So let's get started. Follow the suggestions as you read this article
and by the end you can be pretty comfortable about your everyday
security.

#### Step One: Lock down your email

You probably check mail from several machines and in many places.
If somebody breaks into your email account then they can reset your
password on all kinds of other accounts. Take some time to secure
this vital foundation of your online security.

* Enable two-step authentication for web mail. This will text you
  an additional unique code every time you try logging into your email
  online. You will need to respond with the code after using your
  password. Gmail users can enable two-step
  auth&nbsp;[here](http://www.google.com/landing/2step/).
* [Create](https://accounts.google.com/IssuedAuthSubTokens?hide_authsub=1)
  an application-specific single-use password for your mail client.
  You can later revoke access if you believe your computer has been
  compromised.
* Create and write down a spare single-use password as well just in case.

#### Step Two: Manage your passwords

It's time you make crazy unrelated passwords for all sites. It's
also time to keep track of them in a secure and orderly manner.

* Think of two passwords, one of them very long and difficult. These
  are the only two you will need to remember. Use [a
  system](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) to overcome
  your biases and make strong passphrases.
* Buy [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/mac) ($50) or
  [Lastpass](https://lastpass.com/) ($0) and use your difficult
  password to secure its vault.
* Use your other password for a new [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
  account. Link 1Password to the Dropbox account so you can sync all
  your computers/phones to the same password vault. Linking to Dropbox
  is a simple setting within 1Password.
* Now change your password on all sites you use. You can get good
  auto-generated random passwords from 1Password.

#### Step Three: Protect your computer

* Clear your browser's password cache, and never allow it to remember
passwords.
* Install the [HTTPS
  Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en)
  extension for Chrome, to use a secure connection whenever possible.
* Enable a password-protected screensaver and have it turn on after
  five minutes.
* Add a mouse hot-corner to the screen that starts the screensaver.
  When you walk away from your computer, use the hot corner.
* Ensure your mac firewall is turned on.
* Turn on filevault encryption for your hard drive. Do this before
  you go to bed because it takes a while to encrypt the first time
  it runs.

#### Step Four: Physically secure documents

All your schemes eventually end at physical security. You probably
want to store your master password somewhere your next of kin can
access, along with instructions for how to use it to unlock your
password file. Put this stuff in a safe deposit box at your bank.

Items to store in a safe deposit box:

* social security card
* marriage license
* car title
* birth certificate
* insurance policies
* 1password master key
* backup of 1password filevault on a usb drive
* your spare single-use email password

Do all the above and you're in a pretty secure position. Does anyone
know some tricks I have left out?
