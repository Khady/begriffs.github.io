title: Three-Month 1up Retrospective
---

Over the past three months of tackling my 1up project I have learned
which aspects of its design have worked and which haven't. Rather
than gritting my teeth and continuing to approach the remainder of
the project in the same way, I want to admit my mistakes and make
some adjustments.

First I'd like to mention what has gone well. It has been beneficial
for me to think of a list of possible goals and topics at the start
of the project. Taking the time to clarify to yourself what you'd
like to work on is powerful, since we can otherwise get absorbed
in our personal narratives and be caught off guard by life.

Next, it has been gratifying to share the method with others and
see them run with it. I spoke at the Forward Tech Festival, at
Madison Barcamp, and at the Madison Ruby conference, and each time
felt a lot of energy and enthusiasm around the idea.

I have had fruitful interaction with experts. I divided the year
into two-week learning intervals and generally the more productive
intervals for me have been when I worked with passionate people at
the start. Talking with Dale Sande about CSS style guides, or Matthew
McCullough about Git workflow was really fun and I felt sorry when
the scheduled times came to move on to new topics.

This leads me to my first mistake in designing this program:
attempting two week topics outside of a meaningful project. In my
history as a programmer I have learned most from projects that force
me to learn technologies and techniques as a side effect. I start
with something I really care about, like a startup idea, and the
intrinsic hurdles naturally arise.

Some of my topics have been a bummer when I wasn't able to connect
with someone else to define a meaninful project. "Modern hosting"
for instance. Although I attended a Linux User Group meeting about
EC2, I didn't find a project to sink my teeth into, and I spent
that interval experimenting with Heroku caching techniques kind of
at random. I think I've learned more about Heroku just by accident
while trying to deploy real apps and encountering problems such as
the Heroku read-only filesystem.

My next mistake exacerbated the problem of sterile topics, and that
is the brittle schedule enforced by the program. Each topic is
supposed to be exactly two weeks. As I mentioned before this has
the good effect of creating urgency, but it can be super frustrating
too. Stuff arises and interferes with the impeccable 1up timetable.
Last week, for instance, I put in extra time at work to get a project
back on deadline. Losing a week on a two-week 1up topic discourages
me.

Another problem with assigning myself a series of topics is that
they tend to be too specific and exclusionary. It's hard to cowork
with people when you're locked into a very specific topic. For
instance, declaring that "I'm doing only JavaScript now so I shouldn't
work with someone on their project unless it is JavaScript intensive."
Odds are lower that you'll find someone who is not only interested
in working with you, but can schedule the coworking in the short
term, and is aligned on exactly the topic you're doing. I would now
advocate getting out of the office and being more flexible to work
on cool stuff that might be surprising for you.

So my major lesson is this: I can and should plan **what** I want
to do, but it's foolish to plan up front exactly **how** I'll do
it. Rather than listing a series of lifeless technologies to check
off my list, I should set goals of the things I want to create, and
how I want to help people. It's inevitable that creating a technological
product, for example, will entail learning technology.

Considering my goal, then, what is it I want to accomplish? I started
1up initially by saying, "I want to be a world-class web developer."
That analysis isn't exactly fundamental. Columbus didn't cross the
ocean in order to be a good sailor; he was a sailor in order to
cross the ocean.

To be continued.
