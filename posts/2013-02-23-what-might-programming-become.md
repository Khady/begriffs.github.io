title: What might programming become?

<br />In 1950 the Bourbaki group of mathematicians (particularly Jean<br />Dieudonné) published an article called "The Architecture of Mathematics"<br />which introduces the motivations behind Bourbaki's multi-volume<br />work "The Elements of Mathematics." I'd like to conceive a similar<br />architecture of computing, with a primordial software library of "mother<br />structures" that can combine to efficiently distill any program.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">At the center of our universe are found the great types<br />of structures, ... they might be called the mother structures ...<br />Beyond this first nucleus, appear the structures which might be<br />called multiple structures. They involve two or more of the great<br />mother-structures not in simple juxtaposition (which would not produce anything new) but combined organically by one or more axioms which set up a connection between them... Farther along we come finally to the theories properly called particular. In these the elements of the sets under consideration, which in the general structures have remained entirely indeterminate, obtain a more definitely characterized individuality.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">—&nbsp;<a href="http://mduchin.math.tufts.edu/UCD/111/readings/architecture.pdf">The Architecture of Mathematics</a></blockquote>Programming is a young field and deeply affected by its mercantile<br />allure. Developers create most code without concern for the fundamental<br />patterns and problems involved. The myopic redundancy of this code is a<br />vicious cycle. The new code accommodates faults of the old.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Nothing is more necessary to the culture of the higher<br />sciences, or of the more elevated departments of science, than<br />meditation; and nothing is less suited to meditation than the structure<br />of democratic society. ... Everyone is actively in motion: some in<br />quest of power, others of gain. In the midst of this universal tumult -<br />this incessant conflict of jarring interests - this continual stride of<br />men after fortune - where is that calm to be found which is necessary<br />for the deeper combinations of the intellect?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">— Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America</blockquote>In particular the requirements to cobble shoddy software are quite<br />meager. Most devs are ignorant, especially of math which they know as an<br />irrelevant highschool potpourri of numerical techniques. What we have in<br />math is actually a centuries-old dialog of the most widely applicable<br />structural rules imaginable, rules that cover our software applications<br />as a trivial side effect.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The truths of arithmetic govern all that is numerable. This<br />is the widest domain of all; for to it belongs not only the actual,<br />not only the intuitable, but everything thinkable. Should not the<br />laws of number, then, be connected very intimately with the laws of<br />thought?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">— Gottlob Frege, Foundations of Arithmetic</blockquote>I am curious how to write programs using the concepts from abstract<br />math. Can our programs manipulate topologies, groups, and orders<br />directly? How useful are algorithms expressed entirely in these terms?<br />Can we operate on quotient structures?<br /><br />I don't want this investigation to devolve into crippling type theory<br />banalities or academic drivel. The concepts involved are sharp and<br />lively and the resulting programs should be too. I hereby promise to<br />never present any esoteric implementation of the factorial function.<br /><br />Striving after this noble goal doesn't come cheap. Every day spent in<br />this investigation is a day I make myself less familiar with the latest<br />trends, a less attractive employee. However my thoughts of doing this<br />project and the urge have recurred for years.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I had only to will to go -- but to will powerfully and<br />wholly, not to turn and twist a will half-wounded this way and that,<br />with the part that would rise struggling against the part that would<br />keep to the earth.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">— St. Augustine, Confessions</blockquote>

    I&#39;m a bit late to comment (just found your blog a few days ago), but have you read &quot;Elements of Programming&quot; by Stepanov and McJones? It develops a mathematical basis for generic programming that is rooted in Abstract Algebra. It&#39;s a very interesting read if you can get your hands on a copy.
