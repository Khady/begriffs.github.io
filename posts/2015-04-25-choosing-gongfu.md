title: Choosing 功夫
---

Sitting against the wall in my apartment is a carved wooden cabinet,
about three feet tall and designed for holding musical scores. I
bought it from the back of a Chinese restaurant and brought it home
to store CDs. The cabinet stands quietly on its little curved legs
like a demure traveler from the past, a bit confused by its new
contents. The contrast between the inscrutable disks and their
container is the central image of this essay.

Compact disks (already an antiquated technology) are alien to my
senses. Their information is as invisible to me as cosmic rays. All
I can perceive is a rainbow scattering of light from the surface
of the disk, which is technically a disturbance. I'm like a fish
that can only see the disturbance of waves, unable to intuit the
existence of a boat. Even if I were able to see the microscopic
pits encoding the digital signal they would be visually just a
nonsense jumble, the speed of their audio sampling rate is fathomless
to my mind.

I require a tool to translate the information, and like so many
tools today this one has a pushbutton interface: just press play.
In one way this is a triumph of user design. I should be so lucky
as to press a button and hear a song, or be lifted to another floor
in a building, or make words appear in a document, or create heat
in an oven, or flush a toilet, or light up a room, or divide numbers,
or tell a bus to stop.

However in another way the pushbutton, especially in music, offers
a choice. In Chinese there is a word 功夫, gongfu, which we have
anglicized to Kung Fu. It actually doesn't mean cheesy fighting
moves, it means the studies or practices which take time, patience,
and energy to master. Internalized knowledge that can't be rushed.
"There is no royal road to geometry," as Euclid once explained.

Gongfu doesn't change the outside world, it changes *us*, and that
is why it can't be rushed. The mind works by delicate neural habits
that take time to wear into the brain. Our biggest challenge in a
plentiful society is choosing our gongfu.  Conveniences like recorded
music present us this choice.

I'm grateful for audio recordings. They have expanded my musical
knowledge far beyond what I might have gleaned from random local
live performances. The danger, however, is that I fall back on
recordings as a crutch and never develop real appreciation through
playing music. The composer and conductor John Philip Sousa lived
while audio recording was going mainstream and he watched the changes
brought about by this technology. In [The Menace of Mechanical
Music](http://explorepahistory.com/odocument.php?docId=1-4-1A1) he worried that

> The child becomes indifferent to practice, for when music can be
> heard in the homes without the labor of study and close application,
> and without the slow process of acquiring a technic, it will be
> simply a question of time when the amateur disappears entirely, and
> with him a host of vocal and instrumental teachers, who will be
> without field or calling.

Thankfully this is not what I noticed this evening. I decided to
visit the [San Francisco Community Music Center](http://sfcmc.org/)
on 21st and Capp St. It was bustling with people of all ages
practicing. I actually could not find a piano practice room available
at the time of night I visited.

There are wonderful materials for people to get started learning
and playing songs. The San Francisco public library has a vast
collection of scores. I was able to find a fairly comprehensive
folio of piano music by Federico Mompou. I checked out the score,
wrote down a little reference on a notecard of the bass- and
treble-cleff notes to help me read the notation more easily, and
went to jump right into one of the simpler songs (Musica Callada).
I'm lucky that I naturally enjoy many songs that don't appear to
require much virtuousity to play.

Learning anything has an opportunity cost. I could settle as I have
thus far in life with enjoying recorded music. I'd have  more time
for coding that way. But we all have a choice of self development,
of the things we want to keep in our minds. Becoming intimate with
a song, actually moving our hands to play it in exactly the same
way as its composer once did, this is a way to feel more empathy.
All recordings suffer from the opaqueness of ease. The sounds emerge
with equal ease in songs of varied difficulty. William James discussed
this perception in *Psychology, a Briefer Course*:

> Only what we partly know inspires us with a desire to know more.
> The more elaborate textile fabrics, the vaster works in metal, to
> most of us are like the air, the water, and the ground, absolute
> existences which awaken no ideas. It is a matter of course that an
> engraving or a copper-plate inscription should possess that degree
> of beauty. but if we are shown a *pen*-drawing of equal perfection,
> our personal sympathy with the difficulty of the task makes us
> immediately wonder at the skill.

The 功夫 tightrope exists in many fields, for instance Chess. In
one way of looking at it Chess is a "solved problem." Computers are
now the world champions and operate by blindly Minimaxing a move
tree. There is a beauty in understanding the problem in these terms
to create a machine that can beat grandmasters. But you can also
feel undaunted as a human and realize that the experience of being
skilled at chess holds meaning and drama. An internal combustion
engine travels faster than a bicyclist but we haven't canceled the
Tour de France.

Same goes for drawing or painting. The best external results are
swiftly achieved with a camera (another pushbutton interface). If
I were documenting a crimescene I would obviously use a camera to
take copious pictures. But there are internal results from manual
artistic reproduction. It is the lingering in a moment for its own
sake. It's as if in the pushbutton world we see ourselves in the
third person, but when following fools' errands like Chess or drawing
we finally inhabit ourselves.

Even the written word has been criticized for how it modifies our
minds. A dialog of Socrates points out how we can fall back on
readymade words to disguise our ignorance.

> And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a
> paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to
> them a quality which they cannot have; for this discovery of yours

> they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing;
> they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing;
> they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without
> the reality.

That's why there are degrees and types of gongfu. I am willing to
weaken my memory in exchange for the richness of recorded history.
The important point is to know the tradeoff.

And that's why I want to begin playing piano songs, to break through
the *musique d’ameublement* and start filling my cabinet with scores
and not just CDs.
