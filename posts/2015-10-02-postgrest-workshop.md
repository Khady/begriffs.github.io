desc: How to start making an awesome API with PostgREST
---

This is a recording of an interactive workshop where we create an
API with PostgREST. It is based on the example created by [Jonathan
Harrington](http://blog.jonharrington.org/tag/postgrest/). It also
contains discussions about various concerns, tradeoffs and
implementation details.  You can follow along with the [gitbook
documentation](https://begriffs.gitbooks.io/postgrest/content/).

A big thanks to [Jonathan Stoikovitch](https://twitter.com/jstoiko)
for organizing the event, [Orange SV](http://www.orangesv.com/) for
the space, [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/) for drinks, and
to the attendees for insightful questions.
