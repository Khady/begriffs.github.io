title: The Order of the Lambda
---

After thinking and writing about forming a study group, I finally
decided to give it a try. I advertised it on meetup.com, calling
the group "The Order of the Lambda." My vision is to create a club
devoted to weekly study of the most beautiful and abstract ideas
of mathematics and computer science.

I wanted to focus on three guding principles that I think are
sometimes lacking in meetups:

1. Deeds, not words: meetings are a focused time to do exercises.
2. Timeless knowledge: study classics, not fads.
3. Uncompromising clarity: learn to understand and teach.

We have had several meetings now, and I am proud of our group and
our progress. Members have been eager to explore the material in a
way I never encountered in a formal classroom setting. Everyone
takes turns at the whiteboard explaining ideas and trying examples.

We chose to start our studies with [An Introduction to Category
Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Category-Theory-Harold-Simmons/dp/0521283043)
by Harold Simmons. Categories were developed in the 1940s as a
general language for describing diverse phenomena in mathematics.
They have subsequently been applied in programming language design
and semantics. It's a broad and beautiful subject and I think it
forms a natural place to begin our journey.
