After thinking and writing about forming a study group, I finally decided to give it a try. I advertised it on meetup.com, calling the group "The Order of the Lambda." My vision is to create a club devoted to weekly study of the most beautiful and abstract ideas of mathematics and computer science.<br /><br />I wanted to focus on three guding principles that I think are sometimes lacking in meetups:<br /><ol><li>Deeds, not words: meetings are a focused time to do exercises.</li><li>Timeless knowledge: study classics, not fads.</li><li>Uncompromising clarity: learn to understand and teach.</li></ol><span style="background-color: white;">We have had several meetings now, and I am proud of our group and our progress. Members have been eager to explore the material in a way I never encountered in a formal classroom setting. Everyone takes turns at the whiteboard explaining ideas and trying examples.</span><br /><br />A picture from our first meeting.<br /><img alt="First Meeting" src="http://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii532/begriffs/highres_129451262.jpg" width="500px" /><br /><br />We chose to start our studies with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Category-Theory-Harold-Simmons/dp/0521283043">An Introduction to Category Theory</a> by Harold Simmons. Categories were developed in the 1940s as a general language for describing diverse phenomena in mathematics. They have subsequently been applied in programming language design and semantics. It's a broad and beautiful subject and I think it forms a natural place to begin our journey.
