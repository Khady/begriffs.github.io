title: The Pilgrimage Begins

I leave this weekend to begin my [programming
pilgrimage](2013-02-04-programming-pilgrimage.html) in San Francisco.
It will be two weeks of high-intensity OSS hacking at twelve
companies. This trip has been a longstanding dream of mine, and
it's a little surreal that it's actually happening.

A big part of what makes this possible is the encouragement,
connections, and financial sponsorship of the company where I work,
the Madison Wisconsin-based Rails consultancy
[Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com/). From code retreats, to craftsman
swaps, to hosting meetups to organizing conferences, Bendyworks is
constantly raising the bar for community involvement and software
quality in the midwest. Now they're helping me with my pilgrimage
to contribute to the companies and open source that we love.

I'll be filming a documentary about the trip. I'd like to interview
fascinating people and learn about their dreams. I'd like to learn
about what's happening in software and how it will be changing.
Finally, I want to get a peek inside the companies that are building
the web and capture some of their energy and direction.

Here are the places I'll be visiting. Thanks to the companies and
individuals who have offered to host me for a day during my trip.
