title: How to Remember, Learn and Teach
---

Throughout the day I encounter many annoying software defects and
tricks. After Googling, reading docs, and browsing forums, I find
workarounds â€” but the process usually stops there. I put the problem
behind me and proceed to the next one.

This is bad for two reasons. First, I often encounter the problem
again and forget the steps to solve it. Second, my solution sometimes
improves or synthesizes the suggestions available online, but I
never get around to sharing it.

Here is a streamlined way of learning from problems, communicating
with a development team, and sharing knowledge.

_As you work_

* Create a Twitter account to act as an activity log.
* Record your progress and struggles using a simple command line
  [script](http://360percents.com/posts/command-line-twitter-status-update-for-linux-and-mac).
* Create another Twitter account for "gotchas" and their solutions.
* When you solve a problem, quickly post it to the gotcha account
  with a brief note of how you solved it. Another shell script can
  make this quick.

_At the end of the day_

* Review your log and gotchas to see what you solved and failed to solve.
* Search again online at [stackoverflow](http://www.stackoveflow.com/)
  etc and see if you can contribute an answer.
* If you have miscellaneous ideas or solutions for problems not yet
  asked, write a quick blog post about it.Reviewing and contributing
  at the end of the day means you aren't interrupted as you work, and
  helps to cement your knowledge. Keeping an ongoing log is the most
  efficient way to keep colleagues informed of your progress, and
  even gives them the chance to notice and nonintrusively suggest
  solutions if you get stuck.

This approach is new for me, and hopefully it will help me pass on the learning.
