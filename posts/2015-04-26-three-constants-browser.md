title: Three Constants to Change the Web Browser
video: true

[Leo Meyerovich](https://lmeyerov.github.io/), CEO of
[Graphistry](http://www.graphistry.com/) asks, "Now that we're
living in the future, what is going to change about the web browser?"
In this video he shows that powerful client GPUs, faster network
latency, and decreasing cost of data-center GPUs allow a very
different world on the web.  Leo proposes splitting the browser
between a highly parallel local rendering engine and data-center
"co-processors." This split allows supercomputer performance for
data visualizations.
