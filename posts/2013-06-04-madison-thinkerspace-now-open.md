Step inside, have a cup of tea, browse the library. A unique room
has opened up on the capitol square -- Madison's own thinkerspace.
It's an idea I have wanted to create and share with people for a
long time, and the&nbsp;generosity&nbsp;of the folks at [100State
Coworking](http://100state.com/) have helped me make it real.

The idea is to create a quiet place away from commercialism, away
from competition. A place to relax with a curious old book, play
chess, prove a theorem, write on the manual typewriter, or chat
with people.

I think adults should feel free to enjoy things for their own sake
rather than being absorbed by the usual middle-class diversions of
career advancement or educational accreditation. Our constant
striving for the means to far-off ends makes us often neglect our
immediate ability to stop and contemplate interesting things.
Education is seen as a childish predisposition that happens during
predefined times and for measured credit. Tocqueville noted about
the US in 1840,

> What chiefly diverts the men of democracies from lofty ambition
is not the scantiness of their fortunes, but the vehemence of the
exertions they daily make to improve them...A man who raises himself
by degrees to wealth and power contracts, in the course of this
protracted labor, habits of prudence and restraint which he cannot
afterwards shake off. A man cannot gradually enlarge his mind as
he does his house.

Fourteen years later Thoreau lamented what he perceived as the
vacuous industry of Americans, and warned us to protect our minds:

> If we have thus desecrated ourselves, — as who has not? — the
remedy will be by wariness and devotion to reconsecrate ourselves,
and make once more a fane of the mind. We should treat our minds,
that is, ourselves, as innocent and ingenuous children, whose
guardians we are, and be careful what objects and what subjects we
thrust on their attention. Read not the Times. Read the Eternities.

So this thinkerspace is dedicated for you to do just that, even for
a little while. Perhaps we can found more of these rooms in cities
across the country, like the Carnegie libraries of old, and cultivate
what dispassionate nobility of mind remains in modern life.
