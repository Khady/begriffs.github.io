title: How to make a simple computer. Really simple.
---

Everyone has different opinions about what types of computer and
software are simple and easy. Edsger Dijkstra believed that the
best computer was no computer at all, and made significant
[contributions](http://bit.ly/pHQKpZ) to computing science with
only a fountain pen, paper, and his mind.

Those of us developing software professionally will obviously not
have this inclination (or luxury?), but we should still think clearly
and comprehensively about the hardware and software we will most
enjoy.

I personally would like to use the same computer at home and at
work, but I don't find a laptop entirely satisfactory. Laptop screens
are low down near the keyboard, causing me to slouch to read. Lifting
the laptop to a higher surface makes an uncomfortable typing angle
for the wrists. Also, the intrusive laptop screen blocks an external
monitor from being placed directly in front of the keyboard. This
makes me have to twist while using a nice monitor.

The solution is a portable computer without an attached screen. I
imagine an elegant wooden lunchbox sized device with a leather
handle and a fold-out or detachable keyboard. I would then carry
it to work, plug it in, fold out the keyboard, attach a monitor.

I would put quality single-purpose parts inside the case, all
connected by USB.

* [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) CPU+graphics
* [USB Hub](http://amzn.to/nP7M0D)
* [Crazy](http://amzn.to/pj2Hhm) wifi
* [SSD](http://amzn.to/qRppye) storage
* [HH](http://amzn.to/qfsync) keyboard
* (**optional**) [3g](http://amzn.to/pt1MQm) modem
* (**optional**) [Sound](http://amzn.to/oWt6Jq)
* (**optional**) [Flash](http://amzn.to/pIezwp) key

If I did want to add a portable screen, I would choose
[this](http://amzn.to/oiFzLr), and design some way to open it out
from the lunchbox and telescope it up to eye level.

The tiny mainboard is the only multipurpose component, but when you
examine it you will see it is breathtakingly pure. Some of the
components above are optional, like 3g. I am not sure I care to pay
for a data plan, or if the lunchbox is particularly usable on the
go anyway.

Where is the mouse? It should be obvious that [real
programmers](http://xkcd.com/378/) don't use [mice](http://bit.ly/nqz7a9).
Well, maybe I'm not _that_ real.

Here is a broad outline of the software I would use

* [Arch](http://www.archlinux.org/) Linux (is this really a surprise?)
* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
* Basic tools, vim, mailx, etc
* [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) window manager
* [Uzbl](http://uzbl.org/) web browser (or Chrome +
  [Vimium](http://vimium.github.com/))There is much more to write
  about choosing software for the "calmputer."
