title: A New Kind of Learning and Coworking
---

I'm happy to announce that a new experiment in collaboration and
learning has begun. My friends [Adam Braus](https://twitter.com/ajbraus),
[Michael Fenchel](https://twitter.com/mfenchel), and [Niko
Skievaski](https://wni.herokuapp.com/www.linkedin.com/pub/niko-skievaski/13/b76/b67)
are creating what I am confident will be Madison's premier coworking
space. They have gotten space on the fourth floor of the beautiful
building at 100 State Street and have invited me to use part of it
to create what I've been calling a
"[thinkerspace](2013-03-28-feedback-on-thinkerspace.html)," a bookish
mixture of blackboards, comfortable reading chairs, tea and classics.

However the thinkerspace will be more than antiques and chalk, it
will be an experiment in a new kind of learning and teaching. The
idea is that learning happens best when it's collaborative,
exploratory, and hands-on. Small groups of people will work together
to solve small well-defined problems. They then emerge as "guides"
able to pass the knowledge along to other groups.

Whereas schools traditionally design long-running courses covering
broad subjects with passive lessons, the thinkerspace will immerse
small groups in exactly the questions and techniques that interest
them.

For instance, someone might want to

* play the *Trois Gymnop√©dies* on the piano
* prove the Pythagorean theorem
* paint a realistic apple
* learn Spencerian penmanship
* bind a book

They could work in a group and compare results. When someone feels
they have succeeded, they can advertise themselves in a thinkerspace
directory as a guide for that skill. New groups of people wanting
to learn the skill can look guides up and coordinate a lesson. The
opportunity to pass your skill along helps you learn it even better.

Because the thinkerspace is part of a broader coworking scene,
members can venture out of the old-fashioned reading-chair corner
and over to the technological side to practice and teach programming
and entrepreneurship. I am personally happy to act as a guide for
programming topics such as those I studied in my [1up
project](http://1up.begriffs.com/).

The thinkerspace approach to teaching fits well within the philosophy
of the coworking space as a whole. Michael Fenchel explained to me
that, "This coworking space is different than many. We want it to
be more than individuals who happen to be working in the same room
on solo projects. We want to help actively connect people to build
strong teams with complimentary strengths."

This week we'll be moving in and furnishing the building. It's
definitely exciting, and I'll post pictures and updates as things
progress.
