title: Feedback on the "Thinkerspace"
---

I asked Hacker News for their opinion of a "thinkerspace," a maker
space for those interested in math, music, and conversation. It
would be a modern-day salon â€” a place to meet for study, good
conversation, and a slow non-technological pace.

My original description of the thinkerspace was intentionally rather
vague and included a freeform field for additional thoughts. I got
plenty of feedback, but first here is what I described the space
having:

* comfortable reading chairs
* library of math books and classics
* fountain pens
* cozy lights
* a piano and library of scores
* blackboards
* tea
* painting supplies
* bookbinding

The results are interesting. My poll got 9300 views and 380 answers.
About two-thirds of respondents, 259 to be specific, said they would
become members if there was a thinkerspace in their city. This is
a 2.8% conversion rate, which is right in line with the mythical
2-3% "average" conversion rate across all web sites.

To get an idea of how viable the idea would be, I asked the maximum
monthly membership fee people would be willing to pay. Here are the
results, rounded to the nearest five dollars.

Since those are the maximums, we can calculate the total monthly
revenue at different choices of monthly fee. Looks like $50 per
month is the best fee. This calculation assumes (probably incorrectly)
that people's price sensitivity is the same across their various
cities, but it gives us a rough idea.

However it's not all rainbows and puppies. There were several
criticisms of the idea -- everything from "fuk no" all the way to
article-length diatribes. These criticisms were very helpful,
especially because many of the themes were repeated. It's clear
that the thinkerspace, if it ever exists, absolutely needs to avoid
certain things.

#### Objection 1: Pretension

The P-word is the #1 worry. Whether it is the anachronistic trappings
of "flouncy fountain pens" or a crowd of "try-hard pseudo-intellectuals,"
people are sickened imagining the thinkerspace becoming a breeding
ground of pretentious douchebaggery. It needs to work hard to
maintain its seriousness while cutting out the all-talk, no-walk
crowd. One respondent said the space needs to make sure it doesn't
try to confer prestige. Keep it a meeting place for friends who are
curious and want to talk and learn together.

Blowhards pose a real threat to the space, at least if it's no more
than a pay-to-play conversation club. Although one person suggested
"charge enough to keep out the riff-raff," I don't think that fees
alone can keep the company scintillating. Perhaps the space needs
probationary periods for members, where the existing crowd can vote
out obnoxious newcomers. At the very least it needs a low-key name.

#### Objection 2: Redundancy

"How is this any better than *X*?" where X is "my house" or "the
public library" or "a cafe." That depends.

Your house is drab, lonely and distracting. Possibly. If not, then
enjoy your house; you're successful and we envy you.

The public library has books of limited specialization. You won't
find sophisticated math books. You *will* find people playing around
on facebook and homeless people. There aren't usually blackboards
or food.

A cafe is usually full of distracting chatter and zombified people
who are staring at glowing rectangles and don't want to talk to
you. If you don't periodically buy things then you are unwelcome.
The only blackboards you will find are covered with the daily food
specials, not ideas and equations.

Where things get more complicated is how a thinkerspace compares
with a university department or library. These are the original
thinkerspaces after all, and they have developed effective ways to
weed out triflers. Perhaps this is in some ways a weakness of
universities. Attending a university certainly demonstrates dedication,
but can filter people with a genuine interest in a subject who have
other things in their lives preventing them from the fully focused
pursuits of academia.

I am undecided whether a thinkerspace allows broad-minded and
otherwise-engaged people a respite from their everyday affairs and
a meeting of disinterested serious thought, or whether it is nothing
more than a cesspool of second-rate wannabe academics. In fact it
makes me question my own self and my unceasing uneasy interest in
math.

#### Objection 3: Too much/little socializing

Yes, both of these opposite concerns came up. People are concerned
about being bothered while deep in the middle of a thought. They
are also concerned about appearing to be busier than they are and
not being approachable. The idea of musical instruments was worrisome.
Will the jangling of somebody practicing piano interfere with
somebody's reading?

The answer is to define places and times for things. Designate a
social common room for people who would like to be interrupted.
Being there tacitly invites diversion.

Also designate a "Diogenes Club room." Many people referenced this
fictional club from Sherlock Holmes in their responses to my survey:

> "There are many men in London, you know, who, some from shyness,
some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company of their fellows.
Yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest
periodicals. It is for the convenience of these that the Diogenes
Club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable and
unclubable men in town. No member is permitted to take the least
notice of any other one. Save in the Stranger's Room, no talking
is, under any circumstances, allowed, and three offences, if brought
to the notice of the committee, render the talker liable to expulsion.
My brother was one of the founders, and I have myself found it a
very soothing atmosphere."

Practicing piano and generally playing music could be prohibited
during certain times.

#### Objection 4: Overspecialization

Why music and math? Why not philosophy and poetry and psychology?

Yes, I agree, why not? I mentioned math and music because I am fond
of them, but I am not averse to members studying and discussing
other branches of knowledge.

#### Objection 5: Relevance of work

Other people said they wouldn't use the space without wifi, as their
work programming and using the internet is more relevant and
productive than any offline thing would be for them. There is a
danger here. I honestly think that using computers and smart phones
in public makes people antisocial and boring. Yes you too. When you
stare at your phone in a restaurant you are being rude and poor
company. However, real meaningful work does happen on the computer.
Why should we deprive visitors at the thinkerspace from the industrious
and productive thinking that comes from programming and communicating
online?

Let's let people have their cake and eat it too. Here's what I
propose: a public downstairs cafe with wifi, and an upstairs
computer-free, cell-free private club. If you're working on your
startup or checking email do so in the lower level. This is also
where you can get tea, coffee, and snacks. If you're a member you
can climb the stairs to a humane atmosphere of conversation, live
music, and ideas.

#### Objection 6: Monotony

Will a haphazard daily drifting of unfocused thinkers be monotonous
and uninspiring? Although I think people might self-organize into
interest groups with recurring meetings, the space might also plan
events to keep attendance compelling. People suggested that the
space could host guest lectures on various topics. Maybe host
workshops too on tricky games like chess, go, and bridge.

#### Similar Spaces

I got several recommendations for the [Mechanic's Institute
Library](http://www.milibrary.org/) in San Francisco. Since I am
currently visiting SF, I went and checked it out. It really is
outstanding. It's a large private library and intellectual center.
It includes a chess club and meeting rooms in a stately building
with a winding staircase. So yeah, I guess San Francisco is already
covered. Just organize study groups and use the Mechanic's Institute.

Another suggestion was "rationality dojos." I must admit the term
connotes awkward nineteen-year-old Ayn Rand fans, but I'll keep an
open mind.

Finally, the following hacker spaces are claimed to be similar:
LVL1, Paragraph Workspace, theOffice, Sandbox Suites, and One Alfred
Place.
