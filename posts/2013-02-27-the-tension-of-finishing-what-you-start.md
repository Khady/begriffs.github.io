title: The Tension of Finishing What You Start
---

I just wrote about how software could use a [mathematical
makeover](2013-02-23-what-might-programming-become.html), and how
it will take calm prolonged thought to make it happen. That's all
well and good but...

<div style="font-size: large; text-align:center">Finish what you start!</div>

###

My existing projects still need my attention. Eighty percent isn't
done. Ninety percent isn't done. A software tool isn't done until
you can demo it without any apology. Its scope may be modest, but
it should do everything it claims.

In my case I should probably stop working on new project ideas
(aside from scheduling my upcoming [programming
pilgrimage](2013-02-04-programming-pilgrimage.html)) until I have
finished [csstrashman.com](http://csstrashman.com/). How do I define
done? CSS Trashman is done when two basic things are complete. One:
somebody can point it at an entire site and get back CSS that is
good enough to replace the existing style. Two: it makes enough
money to pay for its own cloud computing time.

I plan to roll out a freemium model for the site. Its current
capabilities (of refactoring the CSS of a single page) will remain
free, and there will be additional features for paid users:

1. Preserve responsive behavior with media queries.
2. Add styles for pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements like `:hover`,
   `:active`, `:before`, `:after`.
3. Process a whole site at once (a single harmonious style for
   multiple pages).

There is a tension for me between finishing specific tools that I
start and finishing the [1up project](http://1up.begriffs.com/).
Originally last August I resolved to become a world-class web
developer by breaking the year into two-week intervals and studying
one technical topic per interval. The idea was to keep moving through
the topics, advancing briskly.

However the 1up learning and experiments have naturally born fruit
like [CSS Trashman](http://www.csstrashman.com/),
[styleguide_rails](https://github.com/begriffs/styleguide_rails),
and [creepalytics](https://github.com/begriffs/creepalytics), and
[aws_pipes](https://github.com/begriffs/aws_pipes) which need work
to be finished and maintained. Does choosing to finish these tools
mean failing to properly finish 1up? Maybe the tools were the point
of 1up all along. Knowledge is vain if not applied.

The flexibility to adjust plans might be as important as the plans
themselves. I might be foolish to ignore the demand for my tools
and rigidly stick to 1up's original plan of two-week iterations.

Then again, popular demand only refines the status quo, it doesn't
fuel crazy fundamental inventions. I need to balance projects like
refactoring CSS on the one hand with crazy experiments for whole
new languages or ways of writing software. The vague grand ideas
are always tantalizing.

Part of what makes me hesitant to immediately venture directly
toward the grandest vision in software is the recognition that art
is made through constraints. CSS may be rather accidental and
convoluted in some ways, but it is a constraint and hence keeps my
mind grounded and productive. "Just as sound," writes Montaigne,
"when pent up in the narrow channel of a trumpet, comes out sharper
and stronger, so it seems to me that a thought, when compressed
into the numbered feet of poetry, springs forth much more violently
and strikes me a much stiffer jolt."

Finishing what you start is tricky, isn't it? I think what it really
means is to pick constraints, work with them, and iterate toward
something truly satisfying. But enough writing, time to go finish
what I started!
