title: Creativity Bootcamps — the modern αγωγη
---

Ancient Sparta mandated a rigorous physical and mental training
called [agoge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoge) for its would-be
citizens. This fourteen-year ordeal transformed boys into warriors
and cultivated moral courage and physical fitness.

In today's capitalist technological world, thei [creative
class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_class) battles complexity
and apathy to create art, startups, music, etc. I believe that
creative people can reclaim the spirit of agoge by congregating in
what I'd like to call "creativity bootcamps."

Here is how a bootcamp works. Rent space in a warehouse and divide
it in half. Fill one side with chairs, long tables, and blackboards.
Leave the other side mostly empty but with a stash of low-tech
exercise gear like jump ropes, medicine balls, and chin-up bars.
Hang a large countdown timer on the wall. Supply a fast wifi
connection. All this forms "the arena."

The wall timer counts down
[pomodoros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique): 25
minutes then 5 minutes, repeated four times. During each 25 minute
stretch, people in the arena work without interruption (in groups
or singly) on their various projects. When the 25 minutes run out,
people stop whatever they were doing and rush over to the other
side of the room and do a high intensity workout for 5 minutes,
letting their minds temporarily relax from their projects. This is
repeated four times, and then a 30 minute break begins which can
be used for more exercise, surfing the web, having a snack, or
socializing.

Everyone in the arena is on the same clock. They feed off each
other's intensity and camaraderie. And more literally they feed
from the [Syssitia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syssitia), an
austere shared meal. Rather than the disgusting[black
soup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_soup) of old, the meal
might contain [black
bread](http://russianreport.wordpress.com/russian-cuisine-main-salads-soups-desserts/russian-black-bread-%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D1%85%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B1/),
water, and fruit.

Finally, the bootcamp can have an off-the-clock vestibule by the
door where people meet before entering the arena. This is an area
where new people can watch the action to learn how the system works.
The vestibule might also have a reception desk, lockers, and a pile
of clean towels.
